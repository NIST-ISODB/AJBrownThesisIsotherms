# AJ Brown Thesis Isotherms

Repository containing adsorption isotherm data from

**The Thermodynamics and Hystersis of Adsorption**

by A. J. Brown

A Thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy

University of Bristol

October 1963.

Contents:
1. Boundary (equilibrium) Isotherms of Xenon, Krypton, and CO2 adsorption on Vycor Glass
2. Scanning Isotherms of Xenon on Vycor Glass
3. Edited/corrected versions of (1) and (2)
4. Jupyter notebooks that extract and plot specific sets of scanning isotherms from (2)
5. Python functions to:
- extract specific isotherms (run/segment combinations) from the master source data
- process specific isotherms to a standardized form, where the adsorption measurement is normalized again adsorbent mass and pressure is converted to nominal units
- preserve _significant figures_ in all numerical conversions
